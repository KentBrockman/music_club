python manage.py runserver
```

## Testing

TBD

## TODO

- Example data for automated testing
- Views
- Script to pull data from Google Sheets
- search TODO for additional things...
- music_group isnt a good app name...maybe call it core? or should app be called music_club and project should be something else?
